## Discovering Differential Equations with Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Symbolic Regression

This repo hosts a case study where physics-informed neural networks and symbolic regression techniques are leveraged to discover ordinary differential equations.

- Discovering_Kraichnan_orszag_system.ipynb: this notebook showcases how to implement a physics-informed neural network to perform system identification. 
- symbolic_regression.py: this script showcases how to use PySR library to perform symbolic regresison to distill analytical expressions from a trained neural network model.
